# SIGs @ denhac

_This doc is heavily inspired by [Kubernetes Governance](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/committee-steering/governance/sig-governance.md)_

## What are SIGs?

Special Interest Groups or SIGs are volunteer groups organized around a logical part of the space (3d printing, textiles, etc). These groups are empowered by the board to make decisions scoped to their charter and can be given a monthly operational budget to spend at their discretion.

## What is expected of a SIG?

SIGs are expected to adhere to the following guidelines:

- Have a charter approved by the board.
- Meet regularly with an open agenda, for at least 30 minutes a month, or decide to cancel if no agenda.
- Keep up-to-date meeting notes on the denhac wiki or a Google Doc linked to/from the wiki.
- Follow the budget process laid out by the board and treasurer.
- Help members to draft and present larger proposals for approval by the board.
- Provide an update for the quarterly all-SIG denhac meeting, or otherwise as appropriate in board meetings.

## How do I create a SIG?

SIGs can be created when a specific area of the space has a group of interested members. The group should meet, determine the goals for the SIG, propose Leads, and write a charter document for the board to approve. 

Example potential SIGs for denhac:

- Network
- 3D Printing
- Laser
- CNC
- Woodshop

## Who leads a SIG?

SIGs are led by formal leaders that are initially appointed by the board when the SIG Charter is approved. The Vice-Chair of the board is the first point of contact for SIG matters if the SIG leaders need support.

### SIG Leads

- Each SIG needs at least one lead and can have as many as three leads, two is recommended. 
- A SIG lead serves for up to one year at a time (unless they need to step down earlier) and can renew for additional terms of length of up to one year indefinitely.
- SIG leads are expected to appoint their successor leads by self-organization within the SIG. 
- The intent of being a SIG Lead is to be a steward of part of our shared space and to help make it better. Part of stewarding the space is growing others to step up in the future and not being the sole owner of the area of focus. 
- It is recommended that SIG leads should rotate occasionally to allow the introduction of new ideas and to allow space for prospective leaders to grow. 
- SIG leads must be a current Member in Good Standing of denhac and have been in good standing for a minimum of three (3) months, and capable of fulfilling the expectations of SIG Lead leadership, including providing reports to the board. 
- If these expectations are not met the leads may be removed as a Lead by the board even if they are otherwise in good standing.
- SIG leads are always approved by board vote if there is not any active lead for that SIG (i.e. reviving a SIG). Members of a SIG which has no current active lead are encouraged to consult with the Vice-Chair of the board to guide this process. Active SIG leads can appoint a successor without a board vote.
- The board can remove a SIG lead at any time by majority vote. If a member loses good standing they will be removed as lead without requiring board vote. 
- If a SIG has no leads, the vice-Lead of denhac will step in as interim lead until the next monthly board meeting, during which the SIG will either have a new lead(s) appointed or be dissolved.

### Positions of Trust

Positions of Trust can also be formed by a SIG and its leads based on need. These roles will normally grant a SIG Member additional privileges which allow them to perform actions on behalf of the SIG. (e.g. GitHub repository access, trainer status, access to the server room, purchasing abilities)

## What does a SIG Lead do?

Leads are responsible for ensuring that the SIG is adhering to these guidelines in addition to:

- Maintaining and vetting a list of active members and members which are in a position of trust
- Define how priorities and commitments are managed
- Drive charter changes as well as community buy-in
- Facility Meetings as defined above or in the SIG’s charter

Leads have final say over the SIG they lead but should, in good faith, take into consideration any opinion from interested parties. Any disagreement between leads should be attempted to be settled internally first, otherwise the Vice-Chair of the board will serve as a tie-breaking vote. 

All who serve in Leadership roles or Positions of Trust, whether defined above or in a SIG charter, should be a denhac Member in Good Standing as defined by the denhac Bylaws. Members in Good Standing in trusted positions can be removed from the position of trust through means of a vote of the SIG leads, or denhac board vote. Should a Lead of a SIG lose standing with denhac, they will be removed from the SIG Lead position automatically and are not to be reinstated without a board vote.

## What is in a denhac SIG Charter

Every charter will be based on the same template and the four main points that should be covered are Purpose, Scope, Roles and Organization Management.

### Purpose

- This section should describe why the SIG should exist and what you hope to accomplish through the SIG.

### Scope

- This section is to identify what actions and functions the SIG should and should not have authority over.
	- These items are called In-Scope and Out-Of-Scope respectively.    
	- Scope should be used to refine the SIG’s context and protect the SIG from infinitely growing ownership. 

### Roles

- This section will help identify leads as well as any positions of trust governed by the SIG
	- Specific positions will be named in the Charter for each Special Interest Group.
	- Example: Network Managers or Purchaser

### Organization Management

- This section should be used to call out any additional information useful to running the SIG such as meeting cadence, where notes/documents/files will live, how communications will be delivered, etc.

**Optional sections to the charter can be included based on need such as Budget or Amendments.**

- If a Budget section is needed, consult with the treasurer for proper documentation
	- SIGs by default do not get a recurring budget. Your SIG may want a budget if they have consumables - e.g. printer filament, fabric/thread/needles. If your SIG charter includes a budget, the leads can approve spending up to the budget limit without going to the board (or going to the ops budget). Budgets should be tracked by SIG leads in addition to the treasurer. 
- If charter changes are needed, they will be approved by the board in a majority vote.
